Robot Framework and Salesforce Test Files

This repository was created to supply an alternative location to store resource files used to test Salesforce with Robot Framework solutions. This repository is associated with the resource files stored at the following web location: https://softwaretestingqa.com/robot-framework-tutorials-resources/.

It was discovered that the PDF files do not download and save with correct RF language code spacing. Indentation and word spacing are compressed which causes many errors in Robot Framework. Therefore, storing the resources here should allow for copy/paste functions to work properly.
